--- HOW TO USE ---
Running the randomizer:
    Windows users may use the executable file, "fft_rcc.exe". Other users, please run "randomizer.py" using Python version 2.7.

Source iso file:
    The randomizer will ask for a filename. Place your Final Fantasy Tactics iso in the same directory as "fft_rcc.exe" and input the name of the file. Please note that the randomizer needs 1 GB of free space to create the randomized iso. The iso used for testing has the following hash:
    MD5 - aefdf27f1cd541ad46b5df794f635f50
    CRC32 - 8ab1b7b1

Flags:
    Input the following flags to customize your RUMBLE CHAOS CRASHDOWN experience.

    u  Randomize enemy and ally units.
    j  Randomize job stats and JP required for skills.
    i  Randomize innate properties of jobs.
    s  Randomize job skillsets.
    r  Randomize job requirements and job level JP.
    t  Randomize trophies, poaches, and move-find items.
    p  Randomize item prices and shop availability.
    m  Randomize monster stats and skills.

Seed value:
    Input a seed value here, or leave it blank if you don't care.

Output files:
    The randomizer will output a new, randomized iso with the seed in the filename. If you choose to randomize job requirements, it will also output a text file with the new job requirements inside.
