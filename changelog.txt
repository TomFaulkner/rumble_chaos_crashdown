Changelog - FFT RUMBLE CHAOS CRASHDOWN Randomizer

Version 15: MUSTADIO
- Abilities in Math Skill compatible skillsets might become usable through Math Skill (somewhat rare).
- An ability's range/effect/vertical can now potentially become zero.
- Innate status and equippable item randomization is both more likely and less extreme.
- Confusion, Charm, and Berserk removed as a possible initial status (weird behavior).
- Deployed units don't have their stuff randomized (possible source of glitches?)
- Move-find items have been incentivized a bit more
- Additional fun

Version 14: DISCOVERY RACE
- Job requirements are now shown in tree form
- Monsters in mandatory fights are less aggressively randomized, with the exception of Boco.
- Low level enemy ninjas (probably) can't throw shurikens or balls at Gariland anymore.
- Ability randomization is both more likely and less extreme
- Starting jobs have slightly lower requirements, to increase variety on both sides
- Previously removed secondary skillsets, such as All Swordskill, were added back.
- Fixed a bug where a skillset could exceed the 16 skills limit.
- Information about version and difficulty setting is written to the rom

Version 13: SERPENTARIUS
- Fixed a bug in the ranking algorithm that caused high level monsters to frequently appear on Mandalia Plains.
- Units with fixed equipment or fixed RSMs might now have those things randomized.
- Teleport 2 appears less frequently as a monster's innate ability.
- Innate job attribute randomization no longer scales with job rank; low ranking jobs are just as likely to receive a powerful innate as a high ranking job.
- Secondary ability randomization more often results in useful abilities.
- Boco is more likely to become an interesting monster.
- Various minor changes related to balance.

Version 12: ZODIAC BLITZ
- In honor of version 12, the Zodiac Demon fights have been BEEFED UP.
- Fixed the bug where items would appear in non-Item skillsets.
- Linear (single-branch) job trees have been removed to increase variety in enemy units.
- Difficulty can be adjusted on a sliding scale. The "normal" difficulty value is indicated.
- More rewarding poaches and move-find items.
- "Rare" poaches and move-find items are now randomized on a uniform distribution, meaning very powerful items can be obtained very early.
- Skillset shuffling is handled in a more interesting way, instead of locking many skills into guest characters.
- Jobs are ranked according to overall stats, instead of by units using those jobs.
    (With other minor changes, more interesting encounters should result.)
- Ability learn rates are randomized more arbitrarily, to create more variation in enemy's skills.
- Slightly less rewarding war trophies.
