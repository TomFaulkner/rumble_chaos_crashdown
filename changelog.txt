Changelog - FFT RUMBLE CHAOS CRASHDOWN Randomizer

Version 26: DYCEDARG
- More Altimath rebalancing.
- Removed most shop and menu music from the random music pool.
- Various bugfixes and gameplay tweaks.

Version 25: BEOWULF
- Adjusted Altima. On higher difficulties she'll probably still have some math capability and there's a chance she'll be even harder, but in general she should be slightly easier.
- Various minor bugfixes and balance changes

Version 24: ALTIMA
- Spiced things up here and there.
- Poaches are now listed in the text file.
- Cloud was missing from the skillset shuffle, and has been re-added.
- Formation sizes are no longer reduced on any difficulty setting.
- Extra units should be color coded based on their team allegiance now, instead of always being enemy-colored.
- True End conditions were made a little more reasonable on higher difficulties.
- Lionel castle weather/daytime is no longer randomized. Hopefully this fixes the gate bug but I didn't test it.

Version 23.2:
- Fixed a bug that caused the randomizer to not enforce a variety of songs in the soundtrack. We shouldn't see 5 battles in a row that all have the proposition theme, anymore.

Version 23.1:
- The randomizer is now playable on consoles, provided that the console has been modded to read burned disks. (I updated the CD-ROM utility to regenerate error detection and error correction codes.)

Version 23: ALGUS
- Plugged an RNG leak. It's a funny story. I thought I was being clever by defining Job A as "less than" Job B if A's job requirements are a subset of B's. Of course, this is a partial order, not a total order, so a list of job requirements can be sorted in multiple valid ways. This resulted in an unmanaged random element, and it turns out that if one of your job's requirements is off by just ONE level, it has a cascading effect that spreads to everything else.
- Fixed an error where units would attempt to spawn on top of lava.
- Updated the main mutation function to use a glorious True Normal Distribution instead of a triangular distribution. The resulting randomizations should be mostly the same, perhaps slightly more conservative.
- Updated support for the Japanese version.
- Fixed a typo that prevented the full range of item attributes from being randomized.

Version 22: ALMA
- The 'y' and 'w' randomization flags have been added. (contributed by Ryason55)
	'y' - Randomize ability and weapon status effects
	'w' - Randomize weapon and item stats.
- Generic unit names were updated.
- Minor balance changes and bugfixes.

Version 21.2:
- In addition to weather effects, night effects are also patched.
- Units will no longer be allowed to spawn in deep water.
- Wild Altimas will have Ultimate Magic

Version 21.1:
- Freezing glitch was determined to be related to weather effects, and was subsequently patched. If you encounter any more glitches, please let me know.

Version 21: DELITA
- WARNING: This version includes some big changes that have not seen rigorous testing. There may be bugs. If you would like to play it safe, I recommend disabling the 'f' flag, which will disable many of the more experimental randomizations.
- WARNING: One user reported a freezing glitch at Bethla Sluice. I have not been able to reproduce this glitch. (FIXED?)
- WARNING: This version will not work on the Japanese version of FFT.
- "True" formation randomization has been implemented, meaning enemy and ally positions can end up in completely different places on certain maps. Some battles may include additional enemy units.
- Under certain conditions, battles may occur on new maps.
- Reduced party sizes are less likely and will not occur on the default difficulty setting.
- Zodiac demons have been buffed once again.
- Enemy units have been indirectly buffed by giving them smarter options and by giving late game classes better stats.
- The ending was modified to be less dumb.
- The soldier office is now free.
- Traps/items only appear on walkable tiles now, making them a bit more common.
- Various tweaks to balance and probabilities.

Version 20: UNNAMED
- This was a beta version that included many of the features scheduled for version 21. This version was not publically released.

Version 19: LARG
- Battle formations, weather, and music are randomized.
- Cutscene autoplay feature added to the NA version.
- Wiegraf is always accompanied by female units.
- Minor adjustments to improve variety.

Version 18: SIMON
- Removed enemy Ramzas from mandatory battles (too glitchy)
- Removed some skills that will crash the game if used
- Updated unit names

Version 17: TETA
- A mistake in stat growth randomization was fixed
- Unit names are now randomized

Version 16: BALMAFULA
- The randomizer now supports the Japanese version of FFT.
- Random battles have been removed from the NA version. Move to a green dot to fight a battle there.
- Fixed a bug where Boco could become an enemy unit, and was impossible to save.
- Only Thieves have access to secret hunt (not sure, but I believe this is necessary because the fur shop is hard-coded)
- Cloud's Limit skills, if shuffled into a new skillset, no longer require the Materia Blade to use.
- Monsters can use sword skills even without a sword.
- Made REV randomization even more common
- Adjusted ability learn rates so that learned abilities aren't all clustered near the top of the list.
- Adjusted skill shuffling so that sword skills don't get swapped into other skillsets so often.
- Various minor fixes and balance changes.

Version 15: MUSTADIO
- Abilities in Math Skill compatible skillsets might become usable through Math Skill (somewhat rare).
- An ability's range/effect/vertical can now potentially become zero.
- Innate status and equippable item randomization is both more likely and less extreme.
- Confusion, Charm, and Berserk removed as a possible initial status (weird behavior).
- Deployed units don't have their stuff randomized (possible source of glitches?)
- Move-find items have been incentivized a bit more
- Additional fun

Version 14: DISCOVERY RACE
- Job requirements are now shown in tree form
- Monsters in mandatory fights are less aggressively randomized, with the exception of Boco.
- Low level enemy ninjas (probably) can't throw shurikens or balls at Gariland anymore.
- Ability randomization is both more likely and less extreme
- Starting jobs have slightly lower requirements, to increase variety on both sides
- Previously removed secondary skillsets, such as All Swordskill, were added back.
- Fixed a bug where a skillset could exceed the 16 skills limit.
- Information about version and difficulty setting is written to the rom

Version 13: SERPENTARIUS
- Fixed a bug in the ranking algorithm that caused high level monsters to frequently appear on Mandalia Plains.
- Units with fixed equipment or fixed RSMs might now have those things randomized.
- Teleport 2 appears less frequently as a monster's innate ability.
- Innate job attribute randomization no longer scales with job rank; low ranking jobs are just as likely to receive a powerful innate as a high ranking job.
- Secondary ability randomization more often results in useful abilities.
- Boco is more likely to become an interesting monster.
- Various minor changes related to balance.

Version 12: ZODIAC BLITZ
- In honor of version 12, the Zodiac Demon fights have been BEEFED UP.
- Fixed the bug where items would appear in non-Item skillsets.
- Linear (single-branch) job trees have been removed to increase variety in enemy units.
- Difficulty can be adjusted on a sliding scale. The "normal" difficulty value is indicated.
- More rewarding poaches and move-find items.
- "Rare" poaches and move-find items are now randomized on a uniform distribution, meaning very powerful items can be obtained very early.
- Skillset shuffling is handled in a more interesting way, instead of locking many skills into guest characters.
- Jobs are ranked according to overall stats, instead of by units using those jobs.
    (With other minor changes, more interesting encounters should result.)
- Ability learn rates are randomized more arbitrarily, to create more variation in enemy's skills.
- Slightly less rewarding war trophies.
