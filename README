--- HOW TO USE ---
Running the randomizer:
    Windows users may use the executable file, "fft_rcc.exe". Other users, please run "randomizer.py" using Python version 2.7.

Source ISO file:
    The randomizer will ask for a filename. Place your Final Fantasy Tactics ISO in the same directory as "fft_rcc.exe" and input the name of the file. You must include the file extension (ex: fft.img). Please note that the randomizer needs 1 GB of free space to create the randomized ISO. The ISOs used for testing have the following hashes:
    MD5 - b156ba386436d20fd5ed8d37bab6b624
          aefdf27f1cd541ad46b5df794f635f50
          3bd1deebc5c5f08d036dc8651021affb (J)
    CRC32 - 377f6510
            8ab1b7b1
            a6361fd1 (J)
    If your file is about 517 MB then it's probably correct.

Flags:
    Input the following flags to customize your RUMBLE CHAOS CRASHDOWN experience.

    u  Randomize enemy and ally units.
    j  Randomize job stats and JP required for skills.
    i  Randomize innate properties of jobs.
    s  Randomize job skillsets.
    a  Randomize abilities, including CT, MP cost, etc.
    r  Randomize job requirements and job level JP.
    t  Randomize trophies, poaches, and move-find items.
    p  Randomize item prices and shop availability.
    m  Randomize monster stats and skills.
    z  Enable special surprises.

Seed value:
    Input a seed value here, or leave it blank if you don't care.

Chaos multiplier:
    This is a difficulty setting for RCC. It mainly affects enemy stats and the level of treasure you acquire. The standard difficulty is 1.0, with 0.5 being quite easy and 1.5 being quite hard. Difficulty scales quadratically with the chaos multiplier, so don't raise it too high!

Output files:
    The randomizer will output a new, randomized ISO with the seed in the filename. If you choose to randomize job requirements, it will also output a text file with the new job requirements inside.
